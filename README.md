* Vehicle length, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD have a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
* The p-value of our linear regression is 5.35 x 10<sup>-11</sup>. This number is much smaller than the assumed significance of 0.05%. The slope of our line is not zero. 
* The multiple R-squared value of 0.71 indicates that the variablity of mpg is explained using this model.  However due to the amount of non-random variables to mpg, transformation of some the independent variables may need to be performed and then reevaluate there significane to get a better understanding of the variance.

* Design speicifications for the MechCar suspension coils dictate the the variance of the suspension coils not exceed 100 pounds per square each. When totalled together, all lots do not meet design specifications.  When taken individually Lots 1 and 2 meet specification because they have approximately one to two vehicles that exceed the 100 PSI.  Lot 3 does not meet design specifications becaus3 it has at least 13 vehicles in the dataset that does exceeds 100 PSI.
