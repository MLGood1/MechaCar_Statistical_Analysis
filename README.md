* Vehicle length, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD have a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
* The p-value of our linear regression is 5.35 x 10<sup>-11</sup>. This number is much smaller than the assumed significance of 0.05%. The slope of our line is not zero. 
* The multiple R-squared value of 0.71 indicates that the variablity of mpg is explained using this model.  However due to the amount of non-random variables to mpg, transformation of some the independent variables may need to be performed and then reevaluate there significane to get a better understanding of the variance.
